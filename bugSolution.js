The solution is to move the code that relies on props and state to the `componentDidMount` lifecycle method.

```javascript
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { count: 0 };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    console.log(this.props.someProp); // Now safe to access
    // Perform operations that depend on props or state here
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <View>
        <Text>{this.state.count}</Text>
      </View>
    );
  }
}
```
By using `componentDidMount`, we guarantee that `this.props` and `this.state` are populated correctly before we try to use them.
